            <p class="item2">Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different
                beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as
                he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to
                admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
            <p class="item2">At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his
                energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
                ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

            <p class="item2">Loves chasings tennis balls, chipmunks, squirrels, and birds. Often found sitting by the fire in
                wintertime, and in sun patches when available. He’s energetic, mischievous, and easily bored. He loves
                people and gets grumpy if left without a lap too long.</p>
            <p class="item2">Loves barking up trees, running around on the lawn, and digging in the dirt looking for moles. He
                especially likes getting treats and whines when he comes inside and doesn’t get a snack.</p>
